## KEY FEATURES:

- **Life Among the Trees: ‚Äî** Step outside and make yourself at home in nature. With the Natural Living Skill, Sims can meet their needs outdoors without beds or plumbing! The natural world has a lot to offer, and Sims can Forage to uncover what‚Äôs hidden. Find everything from crystals to frogs to food! This way of life is perfect for Sims with the new Nature Nomad Aspiration. Sims can even bring the great outdoors inside with new pots for gardening on tables, counters, shelves, and more. The 3 new traits ‚Äî Plant Lover, Mystical, and Disruptive ‚Äî play a role in how Sims relate to their world.

- **The Fairest Folk: ‚Äî** Do you feel nature‚Äôs mystical pull? Embark on a special journey and become a Fairy! Fairies can develop abilities that let them nurture plants, change the moods of others, and a whole lot more. The new Fairy Stories Aspiration will have you choosing between Harmonious and Discordant Fairy paths! Create Fairy Sims with wondrous wings and make them unique by painting! Plus, add whimsical accessories, glowing tattoos, and more. Non-Fairy Sims can also have magical fun by using Fairy Dust to enchant plants, bring Gnomes to life, and more.

- **A Balanced Lifestyle ‚Äî** Prolonged negative emotions cause imbalance, and imbalance can lead to Ailments with strange effects. They aren‚Äôt always bad (maybe you like lots of Gnomes at your house!), but if you want a Cure, you can turn to the new Apothecary Table and hone your Apothecary Skill. There‚Äôs a Cure for every one of the 8 Ailments, plus 14 more recipes with other fantastical effects. Sims who enjoy the Apothecary skill can become Naturopaths, a new 10-level career where you can cure Sims at home. They may also take on the Elixir Enthusiast Aspiration. Make sure to watch your Luck, which affects everything from cooking well to developing Ailments.

- **A Land of Enchantment ‚Äî** Innisgreen is a beautifully lush, green world where Sims live in harmony with nature. There are 3 neighborhoods: a quiet waterfront town called Coast of Adhmor where they‚Äôre all about Gnomes, Sprucederry Grove where nature and civilization blend together, and the magical forest of Everdew. From meeting Mother Nature and starting your journey towards fairydom to using the Glaswood Tree statue to summon Spruce Almighty, spectacular adventures are waiting!
